A Library Management Website
The project is meant to register all the new students, and a sign-in is available for all those who are already registered. Log-in is checked through a database setup in MySQL server. The database makes different tables for all the users including info on the books they have issued.

Website will display a table containing all the book available in the library once the user has logged in.
User can add any of the shown books by entering the serial-number visible on the side of every book.
Each user has a profile page which presents him with a wishlist of the books he's added
The front page has a link which redirects to administrator page after person has entered the correct administrator password.
Administrator can change the database by adding or deleting any number of books.
Main actors in this project are 'Student' and 'Administrator'
